<p>The native birds are one of our nation&rsquo;s most valuable
assets. Destroy them, and in a comparatively few years
the insects will have multiplied to such an extent that trees
will be denuded of their foliage, plants will cease to thrive and
crops cannot be raised. This is not fancy but plain facts.
Look at the little Chickadee on the side of this page. She was
photographed while entering a bird box, with about twenty-five
plant lice to feed her seven young; about two hundred
times a day, either she or her mate, made trips with similar
loads to feed the growing youngsters.</p>
<p>It has been found, by observation and dissection, that a
Cuckoo consumes daily from 50 to 400 caterpillars or their
equivalent, while a Chickadee will eat from 200 to 500 insects
or up to 4,000 insect or worm eggs. 100 insects a day is a conservative
estimate of the quantity consumed by each individual
insectivorous bird. By carefully estimating the birds in several
areas, I find that, in Massachusetts, there are not less than
five insect-eating birds per acre. Thus this state with its 8,000
square miles has a useful bird population of not less than 25,600,000, which, for each day&rsquo;s fare, requires
the enormous total of 2,560,000,000 insects. That such figures can be expressed in terms better
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
understood, it has been computed that about 120,000 average insects fill a bushel measure. This
means that the daily consumption, of chiefly obnoxious insects, in Massachusetts is 21,000 bushels.
This estimate is good for about five months in the year, May to September, inclusive; during the
remainder of the year, the insects, eggs and larv&aelig; destroyed by our Winter, late Fall and early
Spring migrants will be equivalent to nearly half this quantity.</p>
<p>It is the duty, and should be the pleasure, of every citizen to do all in his or her power to protect
these valuable creatures, and to encourage them to remain about our homes. The author believes
that the best means of protection is the disseminating of knowledge concerning
them, and the creating of an interest in their habits and modes of life. With that object in view, this little
book is prepared. May it serve its purpose and help those already interested in the subject, and may it be the
medium for starting many others on the road to knowledge of our wild, feathered friends.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>It is an undisputed fact that a great many of our birds are becoming more scarce each year,
while a few are, even now, on the verge of extinction. The decrease in numbers of a few species
may be attributed chiefly to the elements, such as a long-continued period of cold weather or ice
storms in the winter, and rainy weather during the nesting season; however, in one way or another,
and often unwittingly, man is chiefly responsible for the diminution in numbers. If I were to
name the forces that work against the increase of bird life, in order of their importance, I should
give them as: Man; the elements; accidents; cats; other animals; birds of prey; and snakes. I do
not take into consideration the death of birds from natural causes, such as old age and disease, for
these should be counterbalanced by the natural increase.</p>
<p>There are parts that each one of us can play in lessening the unnatural dangers that lurk along
a bird&rsquo;s path in life. Individually, our efforts may amount to but little, perhaps the saving of the
lives of two or three, or more, birds during the year, but collectively, our efforts will soon be felt in
the bird-world.</p>
<p><b>How Can We Protect the Birds?</b>&mdash;Nearly all states have fairly good game laws, which,
if they could be enforced, would properly protect our birds from man, but they cannot be; if our
boys and girls are educated to realize the economic value of the birds, and are encouraged to study
their habits, the desire to shoot them or to rob them of their eggs will be very materially lessened.
It is a common practice for some farmers to burn their land over in the Spring, usually about nesting
time. Three years ago, and as far back of that as I can remember, a small ravine or valley was
teeming with bird life; it was the most favored spot that I know of, for the variety and numbers of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
its bird tenants. Last year, toward the end of May, this place was deliberately burned over by
the owner. Twenty-seven nests that I know of, some with young, others with eggs, and still
others in the process of construction, were destroyed, besides hundreds of others that I had never
seen. This year the same thing was done earlier in the season, and not a bird nested here, and,
late in Summer, only a few clumps of ferns have found courage to appear above the blackened
ground. Farmers also cut off a great many patches of underbrush that might just as well have
been left, thus, for lack of suitable places for their homes, driving away some of their most valuable
assistants. The cutting off of woods and forests is an important factor in the decrease of bird life,
as well as upon the climate of the country.</p>
<p>Our winter birds have their hardships when snow covers the weed tops, and a coating of ice
covers the trees, so that they can neither get seeds nor grubs. During the nesting season, we often
have long-continued rains which sometimes cause an enormous loss of life to insect-eating birds and
their young. In 1903, after a few weeks&rsquo; steady rain and damp weather, not a Purple Martin
could be found in Worcester County, nor, as far as I know, in New England; they were wholly unable
to get food for either themselves or their young, and the majority of them left this region.
The Martin houses, when cleaned out, were found to contain young, eggs, and some adults that had
starved rather than desert their family. The Martins did not return in 1904 or 1905.</p>
<p>Birds are subject to a great many accidents, chiefly by flying into objects at night. Telephone
and telegraph wires maim or kill thousands, while lighthouses and steeples often cause the
ground to be strewn with bodies during migrations. Other accidents are caused by storms, fatigue
while crossing large bodies of water, nests falling from trees because of an insecure support, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
ground nests being trod upon by man, horses, and cattle.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of cities, towns, villages, or farms, one of the most fertile sources of danger to
bird life is from cats. Even the most gentle household pet, if allowed its liberty out of doors, will
get its full quota of birds during the year, while homeless cats, and many that are not, will average
several hundred birds apiece during the season. After years of careful observation, Mr. E. H.
Forbush, Mass., state ornithologist, has estimated that the average number of birds killed, per cat
population, is about fifty. If a dog kills sheep or deer, he is shot and the owner has to pay
damages; if a man is caught killing a bird, he pays a fine; but cats are allowed to roam about without
restriction, leaving death and destruction in their wake. All homeless cats should be summarily
dealt with, and all pets should be housed, at least from May until August, when the young
birds are able to fly.</p>
<p>Of wild animals, Red Squirrels are far the most destructive to young birds and eggs; Chipmunks
and Grays are also destructive but not nearly as active or impudent as the Reds. Skunks,
Foxes, and Weasels are smaller factors in the decrease of bird life.</p>
<p>Birds of prey have but little to do with the question of bird protection for, with a few exceptions,
they rarely feed upon other birds, and nearly all of them are of considerable economic value
themselves. Jays, Crows, and Grackles, by devouring the eggs and young of our smaller birds,
are a far greater menace than are the birds of prey, but even these have their work and should be
left in the place that Nature intended for them; they should, however, be taught to keep away from
the neighborhood of houses.</p>
<p><b>How Can We Attract Birds About Our Homes?</b>&mdash;Many birds prefer to live in the vicinity
of houses, and they soon learn where they are welcome. Keep your premises as free as possible
from cats, dogs, and especially English Sparrows, and other birds will come. Robins, Orioles,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Kingbirds, Waxwings and a few others will nest in orchard trees, while in dead limbs or bird
boxes will be found Bluebirds, Wrens, Swallows, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, etc.</p>
<p>A house for Purple Martins may contain many apartments; it should be erected in an open
space, on a ten or twelve foot pole. Boxes for other birds should have but one compartment, and
should be about six by six by eight inches, with a hole at least one and one-half inches in diameter
in one side; these can be fastened in trees or on the sides or cornices of barns or sheds. It is needless
to say that English Sparrows should not be allowed to use these boxes. By tying suet to
limbs of trees in winter, and providing a small board upon which grain, crumbs, etc., may be
sprinkled, large numbers of winter birds may be fed; of these, probably only the Chickadees will
remain to nest, if they can find a suitable place.</p>
<p><b>How to Study Birds.</b>&mdash;This refers, not to the scientific, but to the popular study of our
birds, chiefly in the field. We can learn many very interesting things by watching our birds,
especially during the nesting season, and the habits and peculiarities of many are still but imperfectly
known. One thing to be impressed upon the student at the start is the need of very careful
observation before deciding upon the identity of a bird with which you are not perfectly familiar.
A bird&rsquo;s colors appear to differ greatly when viewed in different lights, while in looking up
in the tree tops, it is often impossible to see any color at all without the aid of a good field glass.
By the way, we would advise every one to own a good pair of these, for, besides being almost indispensable
for bird study, they are equally valuable for use at the seashore, in the mountains, or at
the theatre. We have examined more than a hundred makes of field glasses to select the one best
adapted to bird study, and at a moderate price. We found one that was far superior to any other
at the same price, and was equal to most of those costing three times as much. It gives a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
clear image, magnifies about four diameters, and has a very large field of view. It comes in a silk-lined
leather case, with cord for suspending from the shoulder, and is of a convenient size for carrying
in the pocket. We have made arrangements so that we can sell these at a reasonable price
(money refunded if they are not satisfactory after three days&rsquo; trial).</p>
<p>We should also advise every one to keep a notebook, apart from the Bird Guide. At the end
of the season you can write neatly with ink on the top of the pages of the Guide, the dates of the
earliest arrivals and latest departures of the birds that you have recorded. If you see a bird that
you do not recognize, make the following notes, as completely as possible: Length (approximately);
any bright colors or patches; shape of bill, whether most like that of a finch, warbler, etc.; has it a
medium or superciliary line, eye ring, wing bars, or white in the tail; what are its notes or song;
does it keep on or near the ground, or high up; are its actions quick or slow; upon what does it appear
to be feeding; is it alone or with other birds, and what kind; where was it seen, in dry woods,
swamp, pasture, etc.; date that it was seen. With this data you can identify any bird, but usually
you will need only to glance over the pictures in the Bird Guide to find the name of the bird you
have seen.</p>
<p>I should advise any one by all means to make a complete local list of all the birds that are
found in their neighborhood, but of far greater value than the simple recording of the different
species seen on each walk, will be the making a special study of one or more birds, even though
they be common ones. While, of course, noting any peculiarities of any bird that you may see,
select some particular one or ones and find out all you can about it. The following most necessary
points are cited to aid the student in making observations: Date of arrival and whether in large
flocks, pairs, or singly; where found most abundantly; upon what do they feed at the different
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
seasons; what are their songs and calls at different seasons; when and where do they make their
nests; of what are they made and by which bird or both; how long does it take, and when is the first
and last egg laid; how long does it take them to hatch, and do both birds or only one incubate them;
upon what are the young fed at different ages; how long do they remain in the nest, and do they return
after once leaving; how long before they are able to feed themselves, and do they remain with
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
their parents until they migrate. These and other notes that will suggest themselves will furnish
interesting and valuable instruction during your leisure time.</p>

<p>The numbers and names used in this book are those adopted by the American Ornithologists&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Union, and are known both in this country and abroad. The lengths given are averages; our
small birds often vary considerably and may be found either slightly larger or smaller than those
quoted.</p>
<p>On some of the pages a number of sub-species are mentioned. Sub-species often cause confusion,
because they are usually very similar to the original; they can best be identified by the
locality in which they are found.</p>
<p>Of course the writing of birds&rsquo; songs is an impossibility, but wherever I have thought it might
prove of assistance, I have given a crude imitation of what it sounds like to me. The nests and
eggs are described, as they often lead to the identity of a bird. We would suggest that you neatly,
and with ink, make a cross against the name of each bird that you see in your locality, and also
that you write at the top of the page the date of the arrival and departure of each bird as you note
it; these dates vary so much in different localities that we have not attempted to give them.</p>
<p>As many will not wish to soil their books, we would suggest that they have a leather-covered
copy for the library and a cloth one for pocket use.</p>

They are one of our most valuable birds, for they

<p>The male has the breast band and sides blue-gray, like the

band in addition to a gray band.</p>
<p>Kingfishers may be found about ponds, lakes, rivers, the seaside
or small creeks; anywhere that small fish may be obtained.
Their food is entirely of fish that they catch by diving for, from
their perches on dead branches, or by hovering over the water

them.</p>

<p>The adult male of this species has a rufous breast band, while

<p>The Texan Green Kingfisher is the smallest member of the
family found within our borders. You will notice that all
Kingfishers have the two outer toes on each foot joined together
for about two thirds of their length. This has been brought
about through their habit of excavating in sand banks for nesting
sites. It is quite probable that at some future distant
period the three forward toes may be connected for their whole
length, so as to give them a still more perfect shovel.</p>

<p>Male with a scarlet crest, female with a black one.</p>
<p>These are the largest and most rare of the Woodpeckers
found within our borders. Their decline in numbers is due, to
a certain extent, to the killing of them because of their size and
beauty, but chiefly on account of cutting off of a great deal of
the heavy timber where they nest. They are very powerful
birds and often scale the bark off the greater portion of a tree
in search for insects and grubs, while they will bore into the
heart of a living tree to make their home.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A shrill two-syllabled shriek or whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In holes of large trees in impenetrable swamps. On
the chips at the bottom of the cavity, they lay from three to
six glossy, pure white eggs (1.45 &times; 1.00).</p>

<p>In summer these Woodpeckers are found in heavy woods,
where they breed, but in Winter they are often seen on trees
about houses, even in the larger cities, hunting in all the crevices
of the bark in the hope of locating the larva of some insect.

Downies are one of the commonest of our Woodpeckers and are

They remain in orchards and open woods throughout the summer,
and in winter often come to the windows in places where
they are fed, as many people are in the habit of doing now.
Their food, as does that of nearly all the Woodpeckers, consists
entirely of insects, grubs and larv&aelig;.</p>

<p>Male with whole top of head and back of neck red; female
with forehead and hind head red but crown gray. Both sexes
have the centre of the belly reddish, and have red eyes.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="#bRedHeadedWoodpecker">Red-heads</a>, these birds are noisy, but they have few
of the bad qualities of the others. Besides the regular Woodpecker
fare, they get a great many ants and beetles from the
ground and fruit and acorns from the trees. They are also
said to be fond of orange juice. In most of their range they
are regarded as rather shy and retiring birds.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">412. </span><span class="sci">Colaptes auratus. </span><span class="siz">13&nbsp;inches</span></div>
<p>Male with a black moustache mark; female without, although
young females in the first plumage show some black.</p>
<p>These birds are very often known as &ldquo;Golden-winged Woodpeckers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;High-holes&rdquo; and about a hundred other names in
different localities. Flickers are found commonly in woods,
orchards, or trees by the roadside; on pleasant days their rapidly
uttered, rolling whistle may be heard at all hours of the day.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A rapidly repeated whistle, &ldquo;cuk,&rdquo; &ldquo;cuk,&rdquo; &ldquo;cuk&rdquo;;
an emphatic &ldquo;quit-u,&rdquo; &ldquo;quit-u,&rdquo; and several others of a similar
nature.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A cavity in a tree, at any distance from the ground.
The white eggs usually vary in number from five to ten, but
they have been known to lay as many as seventy-one, where an
egg was taken from the nest each day.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;South Atlantic States. The Northern Flicker

<p>Crown brown and throat gray, these colors being just reversed
from those of the common <a href="#bFlicker">Flicker</a>.</p>
<p>The male is distinguished by a red moustache mark, which
the female lacks. The typical male Red-shafted Flicker lacks
the red crescent on the back of the head, but it is often present
on individuals, as there are numerous hybrids between this
species and the preceding. Flickers are more terrestrial in
their habits than are any others of the family; their food consists
largely of ants which they get from the ground.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;Same as those of the last; both species often utter a
purring whistle when they are startled from the ground.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">416. </span><span class="sci">Antrostomus carolinensis. </span><span class="siz">12&nbsp;inches</span></div>
<p>Male with the end half of the outer tail feathers white, and
the edge of the outer vanes rusty; female with no white ends to
the feathers. Birds of this family have small bills, but extremely
large mouths adapted to catching night-flying moths
and other insects. They remain sleeping during the day,
either perched lengthwise on a limb or concealed beside a
stump or rock on the ground, their colors harmonizing with the
surroundings in either case. They fly, of their own accord,
only at dusk or in the early morning. This species, which is
much the largest of our Goatsuckers, is known to, at times, devour
small birds, as such have been found in their stomachs.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A loudly whistled and repeated &ldquo;chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow.&rdquo;</p>

<a href="#bNighthawk">Nighthawk</a>, but are very easily distinguished by the long
bristles from the base of bill, the black chin, the chestnut and
black barred wing feathers and the rounded tail. Whip-poor-wills
are more nocturnal than Nighthawks and on moonlight
nights continue the whistled repetition of their name throughout
the night. They capture and devour a great many of the
large-bodied moths that are found in the woods, but are never
seen flying over cities like <a href="#bNighthawk">Nighthawks</a>.</p>

<p>The female of this beautiful little Night-jar differs from the
male only in having narrow buffy tips to the outer tail feathers
instead of broad white ones. Like all the members of this
family these birds are dusk fliers, remaining at rest on the
ground in daylight. Their frosted gray plumage harmonizes
so perfectly with their surroundings that it is almost impossible
to see them. Their eggs are nearly immaculate, but usually
show traces of the lavender blotches that mark others of the
family. Their call is a mournful &ldquo;poor-will-ee.&rdquo; They are
found from the Plains to the Pacific, but are not common east
of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Unused chimneys of old dwellings make favorite roosting and
nesting places for these smoke-colored birds. They originally
dwelt in hollow trees until the advent of man furnished more
convenient places, although we would scarcely consider the soot-lined
brick surface as good as a clean hollow tree. Spines on
the end of each tail feather enable them to hang to their upright
walls, and to slowly hitch their way to the outer world.
Throughout the day numbers of them are scouring the air for
their fare of insects, but as night approaches, they return to the
chimney.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A continuous and not unmusical twittering uttered
while on the wing and also within the depths of the chimney.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Made of small twigs or sticks glued to the sides of a
chimney and each other by the bird&rsquo;s saliva. The three to

<p>This beautiful swift is one of the most graceful of winged
creatures. Its flight is extremely rapid and its evolutions remarkable.
They nest in communities, thousands of them
often congregating about the tops of inaccessible cliffs, in the
crevices of which they make their homes. No bird has a more
appropriate generic name than this species&mdash;&ldquo;aeronautes,&rdquo;
meaning sailor of the air; he is a sailor of the air and a complete
master of the art.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;Loud, shrill twittering, uttered chiefly while on the
wing.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>.&mdash;Placed at the end of burrows in earthy cliffs or as far
back as possible between crevices in rocks; usually in inaccessible
places and as high as possible from the ground. It is a
saucer-shaped structure made of vegetable materials cemented
together with saliva, and lined with feathers. The four white
eggs measure .87 &times; .52.</p>

<p>This little gem is the only one of the family found within the
territory included in this book. Owners of flower gardens have
the best opportunities to study these winged jewels, on their
many trips to and fro for honey, or the insects that are also attracted
thereby. With whirring wings, they remain suspended
before a blossom, then&mdash;buzz&mdash;and they are examining the
next, with bill lost within the sweet depths. Their temper is all
out of proportion to their size, for they will dash at an intruder
about their moss-covered home as though they would pierce
him like a bullet. Their angry twitters and squeaks are amusing
and surprising, as are their excitable actions.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A most beautiful creation of plant fibres and cobwebs

<p>This pretty creature is the most graceful in appearance of the
Flycatcher family, if not of the whole order of perching birds.
In the southwest it is frequently known as the &ldquo;Texan Bird of
Paradise.&rdquo; Its habits are very much like those of the <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbird</a>;
as it gracefully swings through the air in pursuit of insects,
it frequently opens and shuts its scissor-like tail. They
are usually found in open country or on the borders of woodland.
They rarely alight on the ground, for their long tails
make them walk very awkwardly, but when they are a-wing
they are the embodiment of grace.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A shrill &ldquo;tzip,&rdquo; &ldquo;tzip,&rdquo;
similar to notes of <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbirds</a>.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Quite large; built of all kinds of trash, such as twigs,

<p>Adults with a concealed orange crown patch; young with
none. From the time of their arrival in May until they leave
us in August, Kingbirds are much in evidence in farmyards and
orchards. They are one of the most noisy birds, always
quarreling about something, and usually coming off victorious
in whatever they may undertake. <a href="#bNorthernRaven">Crows</a> are objects of hatred
to them, and they always drive them from the neighborhood,
vigorously dashing upon and picking them from above and
often following them for a great distance. They have their
favorite perches from which they watch for insects, usually a
dead branch, a fence post, or a tall stalk in the field.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A series of shrill, harsh sounds like &ldquo;thsee,&rdquo; &ldquo;thsee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Differs from the common <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbird</a> in being larger and gray
above; has black ear coverts, and no white tip to tail.</p>
<p>Like the last species, these are very noisy and pugnacious,
and rule their domains with the hand of a tyrant. After they
have mated they quarrel very little among themselves, and
often several may use the same lookout twig from which to
dash after passing flies or moths.</p>

<p>These tyrant flycatchers are abundant west of the Mississippi,
where they are often, and perhaps more aptly, known as
the Western Kingbirds. If possible, they are even more noisy
and pugnacious than the eastern species. They have a great
variety of notes, all rather unpleasant to the ear. Their food,
like that of the other Kingbirds, consists of moths, butterflies,
ants, grasshoppers, crickets, etc., etc., most of which they catch
on the wing.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A shrill, metallic squeak; a low twittering and a
harsh, discordant scream, all impossible to print.</p>

<p>This imposing flycatcher is the largest of the family that is
found in North America. As usual with members of the family
it is of a quarrelsome disposition, but hardly so much so as either
the <a href="#bKingbird">common</a> or <a href="#bArkansasKingbird">Arkansas Kingbirds</a>.
Their large, heavy
bodies render them considerably less active than the smaller
members of the family. On account of the size of the head and
bill, they are often known as Bull-headed Flycatchers.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;Very varied, but similar in character to those of the
eastern <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbird</a>.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;It is said to build its nest at low elevations in trees or
in thorny bushes&mdash;a large structure of twigs and rubbish with

<p>These large flycatchers are very noisy in the mating season,
but their notes are rather more musical than those of the <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbirds</a>.
They appear to be of a quarrelsome disposition, for
rarely will more than one pair be found in a single piece of
woods. They also frequently chase smaller birds, but never
attack larger ones, as do the <a href="#bKingbird">Kingbirds</a>. They have a queer
habit of placing a piece of snakeskin in the hole in which their
nest is located, for what purpose, unless to scare away intruders,
is not known, but it seems to be a universal practice.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A clear whistle, &ldquo;wit-whit,&rdquo; &ldquo;wit-whit,&rdquo; repeated
several times. This is the most common call; they have many

<p>A Ph&oelig;be is always associated, in my mind, with old bridges
and bubbling brooks. Nearly every bridge which is at all
adapted for the purpose has its Ph&oelig;be home beneath it, to
which the same pair of birds will return year after year, sometimes
building a new nest, sometimes repairing the old. They
seem to be of a nervous temperament, for, as they sit upon
their usual lookout perch, their tails are continually twitching
as though in anticipation of the insects that are sure to pass
sooner or later.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A jerky, emphatic &ldquo;ph&oelig;-be,&rdquo; with the accent on the
second syllable, and still further accented by a vigorous flirt of
the tail.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of mud, grasses, and moss, plastered to the sides of

<p>These birds can scarcely be called common any where, but
single pairs of them may be found, in their breeding range, in
suitable pieces of woodland. I have always found them in
dead pine swamps, where the trees were covered with hanging
moss, making it very difficult to locate their small nests. Their
peculiar, loud, clear whistle can be heard for a long distance
and serves as a guide-board to their location.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A loud, clear whistle, &ldquo;whip-wheeu,&rdquo; the first
syllable short and sharp, the last long and drawn out into a
plaintive ending.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A small structure for the size of the bird, made of

<p>In life, the Pewee can best be distinguished from the larger
Ph&oelig;be, with which it is often confounded, by its sad, plaintive
&ldquo;pe-ah-wee,&rdquo; &ldquo;pee-wee&rdquo; which is strikingly different from the
brusque call of the Ph&oelig;be. Pewees are also found more in
high, dry woods where they build their little moss-covered
homes on horizontal boughs at quite a height from the ground.
Like the other flycatchers they always perch on dead twigs,
where their view is as little obstructed as possible.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A clear, plaintive whistle, &ldquo;pe-ah-whee,&rdquo; &ldquo;pee-wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;One of the most exquisite of bird creations, composed
of plant fibres quilted together and ornamented with
rock lichens; situated at varying heights on horizontal limbs,
preferably oak or chestnut, and sometimes in apple trees in
orchards. Eggs creamy white, specked with brown (.80 &times; .55).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;U. S. from the Plains to the Atlantic and north to
Manitoba and New Brunswick; winters in Central America.</p>

<p>This handsome member of the Crow family is sure to attract
the attention of all who may see him. He is very pert in all his
actions, both in trees and on the ground, and is always ready
for mischief. In a high wind their long tail often makes traveling
a laborious operation for them, and at such times they
usually remain quite quiet. They are very impudent and always
on the lookout for something to steal; they are also very
noisy and forever scolding and chattering among themselves.</p>

<p>These are one of the best known and most beautiful birds

They often rob other birds of their eggs and young as
well as food and nesting material. They are very active birds
and are always engaged in gathering food, usually acorns or
other nuts, and hiding them away for future use.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A two-syllabled whistle or a harsh, discordant
scream. Besides these two common notes they make an endless
variety of sounds mimicking other birds.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of twigs and sticks in bushes or low trees, preferably

<p>This Jay is locally distributed chiefly in the southern parts of
Florida, being found principally in scrub oaks. Like the Blue
Jay, their food consists of animal matter and some seeds,
berries, and acorns. Their habits are very similar to those of
the northern bird and their calls resemble those of our bird, too.
They are rather slow in flight and pass a great deal of their time

<p>These Jays are very beautiful, and we are sorry to have to
admit that, like all the other members of the family, they are
merciless in their treatment of smaller birds. During the
summer their diet consists of raw eggs with young birds &ldquo;on
the side,&rdquo; or vice versa; later they live upon nuts, berries, insects;
in fact, anything that is edible.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;Practically unlimited, being imitations of those of
most of the birds in the vicinity.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Not easily found, as it is usually concealed in dense
thickets. The nests are like those of other Jays, loosely made
of twigs and lined with black rootlets. The four eggs that are
laid in May have a grayish ground color and are thickly spotted
with several shades of brown and lilac. They measure 1.05 &times;

in the northern woods. They are great friends, especially of
the lumbermen, as some of the pranks that they play serve to
enliven an otherwise tedious day. They seem to be devoid of
fear and enter camp and carry off everything, edible or not,
that they can get hold of. They are called by guides and lumbermen
by various names, such as Whiskey Jack, Moose
Bird, etc.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A harsh &ldquo;ca-ca-ca,&rdquo; and various other sounds.</p>

often when the mercury is below zero.</p>

They live about the streets and in the parks, building their
nests in crevices of buildings and especially in the framework of
the elevated railroads of the city, and less often in trees. They
lay from four to six pale-blue, unspotted eggs (1.15 &times; .85).
How they will affect other bird life, in case they eventually become
common throughout the country, is a matter of conjecture,
but from what I have seen of them they are quarrelsome
and are masters of the <a href="#bEnglishSparrow">English Sparrow</a>, and may continue their

Their notes are loud, mellow whistles like those of the
other Orioles. Their nests are semi-pensile and usually placed
in mesquite trees not more than ten or fifteen feet from the
ground.</p>
<h3 id="bScottOriole">SCOTT ORIOLE</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">504. Icterus parisorum. 8&nbsp;inches</span></div>
<p>These beautiful birds are found in southwestern United
States, from California to western Texas.</p>
<p>They are said to sing more freely than other members of the
family, but the song, while loud and clear, is of short duration.
Their nests, which are semi-pensile, are often placed in giant
yucca trees, or in vines that are suspended from cacti. The
three or four eggs are pale blue, scrawled and spotted with
black and lavender (.95 &times; .65).</p>

<p>This very brilliantly plumaged Oriole is, perhaps, the most
abundant of the family in southern Texas. It is not as shy a
bird as the two preceding species and is more often found in the
neighborhood of houses.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few kinds of fruits, their food consists
almost entirely of insects; all the Orioles are regarded as
among our most beneficial birds.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A harsher and more grating whistle than that of
most of the Orioles.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually in bunches of hanging moss, being made by
hollowing out and matting the moss together and lining it with
finer wiry moss. Others are placed in yucca trees, such nests
being made of the fiber of the tree. Eggs dull white, scrawled
about the large end with black and lavender (.85 &times; .60).</p>

<p>Male chestnut and black; female dull yellowish and gray;
young male, second year, like female, but with black face and
throat. These Orioles are usually found in open country and,
as their name suggests, have a preference for orchards. They

roadsides. They feed chiefly upon worms, caterpillars, beetles,
grasshoppers, etc., and are one of the most beneficial birds that

<p>Male orange and black; female dull yellowish and gray.</p>
<p>They are sociable birds and seem to like the company of mankind,
for their nests are, from choice, built as near as possible to
houses, often being where they can be reached from windows.
As they use a great deal of string in the construction of their
nests, children often get amusement by placing bright-colored
pieces of yarn where the birds will get them, and watch them
weave them into their homes.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A clear, querulous, varied whistle or warble; call, a
plaintive whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A pensile structure, often hanging eight or ten inches

<p>Female paler and with white on upper tail coverts. As would
be judged from the large bills that these birds have, their food
consists almost entirely of seeds, with occasionally a few berries
and perhaps insects. In certain localities they are not uncommon,
but, except in winter, they are rare anywhere in the
U. S., and east of the Mississippi they can only be regarded as
accidental even in winter. They have been taken several
times in Massachusetts. In winter they usually travel about in
small bands, visiting localities where the food supply is the most
abundant.</p>

<p>Male rosy red; female gray and yellowish.</p>
<p>These pretty birds visit us every winter, coming from Canada
and northern New England, where they are found in summer.
They are very fearless birds and might almost be
regarded as stupid; when they are feeding you can easily approach
within a few feet of them, and they have often been
caught in butterfly nets. They may, at times, be found in any
kind of trees or woods, but they show a preference for small
growth pines, where they feed upon the seeds and upon seeds
of weeds that project above the snow.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A low sweet warble; call, a clear, repeated whistle.</p>

<p>Male dull rosy red; female streaked brownish gray.</p>
<p>These beautiful songsters are common in the northern tier of
states and in Canada. In spring the males are usually seen on,
or heard from, tree tops in orchards or parks, giving forth their
glad carols. They are especially musical in spring when the
snow is just leaving the ground and the air is bracing. After
family cares come upon them, they are quite silent, the male
only occasionally indulging in a burst of song.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud, long-continued and very sweet warble; call,
a querulous whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of strips of bark, twigs, rootlets and grasses, placed

<p>These curious creatures appear in flocks on the outskirts of
our cities every winter, where they will be found almost exclusively
in coniferous trees. They cling to the cones, upon
which they are feeding, in every conceivable attitude, and a
shower of seeds and broken cones rattling through the branches
below shows that they are busily working. They are very
eccentric birds and the whole flock often takes flight, without
apparent cause, only to circle about again to the same trees.
The flute-like whistle that they utter when in flight sounds quite
pleasing when coming from all the individuals in the flock.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A low twittering; call, a short, flute-like whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In coniferous trees, of spruce twigs, shreds of bark

<p>Male, rosy; female, with yellowish.</p>
<p>This species seems to be of a more roving disposition, and
even more eccentric than the last. They are not nearly as
common and are usually seen in smaller flocks; occasionally
one or two individuals of this species will be found with a flock
of the <a href="#bAmericanCrossbill">American Crossbills</a>, but they usually keep by themselves.
While they may be seen in a certain locality one
season, they may be absent for several seasons after, for some
reason or other. They feed upon the seeds of pine cones,
prying the cones open with their peculiar bills.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;Do not differ appreciably from those of the last.</p>

<p>These beautiful little creatures are often known as Thistle-birds
and Wild Canaries, the former name because they are
often seen on thistles, from the down of which their nests are
largely made, and the latter name because of the sweet canary-like
song. Their flight is a peculiar series of undulations
accompanied by an intermittent twitter. They are very
sociable and breed usually in communities as well as travel in
flocks in the winter. Their food is chiefly of seeds and they
often come to gardens in fall and winter to partake of sunflower
seeds, these flowers often being raised for the sole purpose
of furnishing food for the finches in the winter.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Sweet, prolonged and canary-like; call, a musical

roving about the country, feeding on weed seeds; in summer
they repair, either in small bands or by single pairs, to the edges

<p>Male in summer with a black breast and crown, and chestnut

bright markings covered with grayish.</p>
<p>Unlike the preceding Longspurs, these are constant residents
in the greater part of the Western Plains, in some localities
being classed as one of the most abundant birds. They have a
short, sweet song that, in springtime, is frequently given as the
bird mounts into the air after the fashion of the <a href="#bHornedLark">Horned Larks</a>.
They commonly feed about ploughed fields, along the edges of
which they build their nests.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A short, sweet trill; alarm note a sharp chip, and call
note a more musical chirp.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of fine grasses, placed on the ground in open
prairies or along the edges of cultivated fields, often being concealed
beside a tussock; their four or five eggs are clay color
marked with reddish brown and lavender (.75 &times; .55).</p>

<p>Male with a black crown and patch on breast, and chestnut

bright markings obscured by brownish gray.</p>
<p>These are also common birds on the plains of middle U. S.,
but perhaps not so much so as the last species, with which
species they are often found breeding. These finches show their
close relationship to the famous Skylark of Europe by frequently
indulging in the same practice of soaring aloft and
descending on set wings, rapturously uttering their sweet song.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A shrill, twittering warble; call, a musical chirp.</p>

<p>These street urchins were introduced into our country from
Europe about 1850, and have since multiplied and spread out
so that they now are found in all parts of our land from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. Heretofore they have confined themselves
chiefly in the immediate vicinity of the larger cities and
towns, but it is now noted with alarm that they are apparently
spreading out into the surrounding country. They are very
hardy creatures, able to stand our most rigorous winters.
They are fighters and bullies from the time they leave the egg,
and few of our native birds will attempt to live in the neighborhood
with them.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A harsh, discordant sound, which they commence
early in the morning and continue until night.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of straw and rubbish piled behind blinds, in the tops

<p>The chestnut shoulders and white outer tail feathers distinguish

<p>The name Vesper Sparrow is given this bird because of its
habit of tuning up along toward evening; it is perhaps more
often known as the &ldquo;Bay-winged Sparrow&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grass Finch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are found chiefly in dry pastures or along dusty roadsides,
where they start from the ground in front of us, their
white tail feathers showing prominently as they fly, so that
there will be no mistake as to their identity.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A clear, ascending series of whistles, given from a
fence post or bush top; call, a sharp chirp.</p>

<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A hurried gush of silvery tremulous notes.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Sometimes in bushes but usually on the ground; of
grasses arranged in a hollow to form a little cup, and usually
concealed under a tuft of grass or bunch of clover. The birds
usually run some distance from the nest before flying, so that
they are quite hard to find. They lay three to five eggs, white,

<p>These are one of our most common winter birds, easily
recognized, while perching or on the ground, by the white or
pinkish bill, and when flying by the white outer tail feathers
and the gray and white plumage. They are very common
about houses as well as on the edges of woods and in pine
groves, being very tame and coming into the dooryard to feed
upon crumbs or chaff which is often thrown out for them.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A sweet simple trill, which has a beautiful effect
when given by a whole flock in unison.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of grasses, on the ground, usually beside a stone, in a
bunch of weeds or under a small shrub, where it is well concealed.
The three or four eggs are whitish, sprinkled with
reddish brown (.75 &times; .55).</p>

<p>Upper parts streaked with black; back chestnut and gray;
under parts buffy white; tail rounded.</p>
<p>These dull-colored birds are abundant on some of the southern
pine barrens. Their habits are similar to those of the
<a href="#bHenslowSparrow">Henslow Sparrow</a>; they are quite shy and it is almost impossible
to make one show itself above the grass, through which it runs

<p>This is probably the best known, most abundant, and most

northern states, but the majority go farther south, returning
to their summer homes about the first of March. They may
be found anywhere where there are bushes, vines, or hedges, and
often about houses, even in large cities.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Very pleasing and musical, strongly resembling
brilliant measures from that of the Canary.</p>

<p>Upper parts extensively brown and black, breast and sides

<p>These finches are quite abundant in the West, especially
during migrations, but are rather uncommon in the eastern
states. Their habits are similar in some respects to both those
of the <a href="#bSongSparrow">Song Sparrow</a> and of the <a href="#bGrasshopperSparrow">Grasshopper Sparrow</a>. They
are very lively at all times and in the mating season quite
pugnacious. They sit for minutes at a time upon the top of a
bush pouring forth their melody, and they have one of the most
brilliant songs of any of the family.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Loud, clear, and gurgling, after the style of the

<p>Forehead black; crown chestnut with a gray median stripe;
whole upper parts very dark; under parts grayish with brown

<p>A very quiet and unobtrusive species that dwells, as its name
implies, chiefly in swamps. They creep about under the rank
weeds and underbrush like so many mice; they are especially
fond of the soft mires where walking is so difficult for human
beings; they patter around on the soft mud with evident enjoyment,
occasionally walking across an open space of water on
what floating d&eacute;bris they may find available.</p>

<p>In winter we find these large sparrows in quiet swamps and
open woods, where they scratch about among the fallen leaves,
after the manner of domestic fowls; they will scratch energetically
for a few seconds, then pause to see what they have uncovered.
They have a short but loud and joyful song, with
which they greet you on clear frosty mornings, and the effect is
very beautiful when a large flock of them are singing in chorus.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud, clear, and melodious carol; call, a soft chip.</p>

<p>A bird of swamps, brushy pastures, and open woodlands.
They are ground birds and usually found scratching among the
leaves; the male, with his black, white and brown clothes,
makes a conspicuous object, while the female, with her brown
and white dress, harmonizes with the leaves so that it is difficult
to see her. While his mate is sitting on her nest, the male
will frequently sit in a tree top and persistently sing for many
minutes at a time.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Loud and clear, &ldquo;tow-hee-e-e&rdquo; or &ldquo;see-tow-hee-e-e,&rdquo;

They are typical brush birds, satisfied in living a life of security
in their own way, and rarely appear above the surface of
the thick shrubbery except to mount to a conspicuous twig,
pour forth their sweet melodies, and then retreat again.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;A loud chip; a soft, mewing note; song, finch-like,
musical but rather simple.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Either on the ground or in bushes near the ground.
Made of grasses the same as that of any of the sparrows. Eggs
pale bluish gray, thickly speckled with reddish brown. The

<p>Noble in carriage, beautiful of plumage, amiable in disposition
and excellent singers are some of the qualifications of these
large-billed birds. They are southern birds, rarely seen in
northern U. S. unless in cages, for large numbers of them are
trapped for this purpose, a practice that is being stopped as
rapidly as possible by enforcing the laws which protect them.
They are hardy birds, often passing the winter in the northern
parts of their range when the ground is covered with snow.
They frequent gardens, plantations, and open woods, where
they glean their food of seeds, berries, fruit, and insects.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud, clear, and lively warble; call, a low chip.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A frail structure of twigs, in thickets or bushes; eggs
greenish blue with reddish-brown spots (1.00 &times; .73).</p>

<p>Notice that the bill of this species is very stout and short,
more like that of a parrot. The crest is also composed of
fewer feathers than that of the <a href="#bCardinal">Cardinal</a>. It is only in the
highest of plumages that the red on the underparts is continuous
from bill to tail; usually it is broken into patches. The
female is much duller in color than the male, but always has a
strong tinge of rose color. They frequent more open and exposed
positions than do Cardinals and are more shy in their
disposition.</p>

<p>Without any exception, these are the most gaudily plumaged
North American birds, but their colors have a harshness of contrast
that renders them far less pleasing to the eye than many
others of our birds. They are often caged, but in confinement
soon lose the natural brilliancy of their plumage. Like the

<p>Male, black and white; female, brown and gray.</p>
<p>This species is often known as the White-winged Blackbird,
not because it bears any resemblance to any of the Blackbirds,
nor because any of the habits are the same, but simply because
of its plumage. They are very gregarious and usually fly in
flocks even in nesting time.</p>
<p>They seem to be very methodical and well trained; if one of a
flock takes wing, the entire flock rises simultaneously and in a
very compact body they fly until some leader chooses the next
stopping place, when they as suddenly alight. They have the
habit of Skylarks in mounting into the air while singing and
then descending on set wings.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A very lively, sweetly modulated warble.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground, usually under a tuft of grass or small
bush; four or five eggs of a bluish color (.85 &times; .65), brighter than
those of the Dickcissel.</p>

<p>Male, scarlet and black; female, greenish yellow and blackish.</p>
<p>These beautiful birds are found in open woods, but they often
come out in fields, parks, orchards and sometimes in yards
when feeding; one of the prettiest sights that I ever saw was of
about a dozen of these birds tripping along the furrows of a
ploughed field, where they were feeding on insects. Besides
berries and seeds, they live upon quantities of insects, frequently
catching them on the wing in true Flycatcher style.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Resembling that of the <a href="#bAmericanRobin">Robin</a>, but harsher, less
varied and higher pitched. Call, a sharp chip or &ldquo;chip-churr.&rdquo;</p>

branches of trees; eggs four, pale bluish green, spotted with
brown (.95 &times; .65).</p>

<p>These Tanagers have a more southerly distribution than the
Scarlet variety, but are found in the same kind of territory. In
its localities it is rather more abundant and less retiring than is
the latter bird in the north, and more often dwells in public
parks. This bird is often called the Redbird and in localities
where both the <a href="#bScarletTanager">Scarlet Tanager</a> and this species are found, they
are frequently known by the same name, as their habits and
notes are similar.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Similar to that of the <a href="#bScarletTanager">Scarlet Tanager</a> but said to be

<p>Male, blue black; female, dull black and grayish.</p>
<p>These large, jolly Swallows are commonly seen about cities
and towns within their range. Originally they dwelt in hollow
trees, and some do yet, but the majority have recognized the
superiority of man&rsquo;s dwelling and now live in houses built
especially for them or in cornices of houses or barns. It is no
uncommon sight to see a handsome gabled structure of many
rooms, perched upon a twelve-foot pole, on the lawns of many
wealthy residents; others less bountifully supplied with this
world&rsquo;s goods use plain soap boxes for the same purpose, and
the Martins seem to like the one as well as the other.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A strong, varied grating warble or twitter, more
forcible than melodious.</p>

<p>Adults similar in plumage but the female slightly paler.
Easily distinguished from the <a href="#bBarnSwallow">Barn Swallow</a> by the square
tail and light buffy forehead and rump.</p>
<p>This is what is commonly called the Eave Swallow in the
East, because of its habit of plastering its nests on the outside
of barns or other buildings, up under the eaves. In the West
they usually resort to cliffs where, sometimes, large sections of
the face will be completely covered with the little mud flasks;
often colonies of several thousand will build their nests together.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A continuous twitter, uttered while on the wing or
at rest.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A flask or gourd-shaped structure of mud, lined with
straw and feathers, attached under the eaves to the outside of
buildings or on the faces of cliffs; five to seven eggs are laid;
white dotted and spotted with reddish brown (.80 &times; .55).</p>

<p>Female duller plumaged and with a less deeply forked tail
than the male. Forehead and throat chestnut and entire
under parts buffy; tail deeply forked and with a white spot on
the inner web of each feather except the central pair.</p>
<p>This is the most graceful and beautiful of all our swallows,
and is the most common about farmhouses, the inside beams
and rafters of which they appropriate for their own use. They
delight in skimming over the rolling meadows or the surface of
ponds, now rising with the wind, now swooping downward with
the speed of an arrow.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A continuous, rapid twitter.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A bowl-shaped structure made up of pellets of mud
cemented together with the birds&rsquo; saliva, and lined with
feathers; attached to rafters in barns, the opening being at the
top and not at the side as in the last; eggs exactly like those of

<p>These Swallows are also abundant about farmyards; except
when they are skimming over ponds, they are almost always
scouring the air above buildings or fields, at higher elevations
than the <a href="#bBarnSwallow">Barn Swallows</a>. When weary they roost on dead
twigs or telephone wires, hundreds often being seen in rows on
the latter. Like the <a href="#bPurpleMartin">Martins</a>, these birds frequently nest in

across the breast, showing in bold relief against the lighter
throat. They are found throughout North America, breeding
from the middle of the U. S. north to the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>Plumage very soft colored with a general brownish tone,
shading to gray on the rump. The Waxwings are named from
the curious wax-like appendages attached to the tips of the
secondaries, and rarely to the tail feathers. They are very
sociable and usually feed in flocks. They live chiefly upon fruit
and are especially fond of cherries, for which reason they are
very often known as Cherry-birds. They are very tame and
allow any one to almost touch them while they are feeding or
sitting upon their nests.</p>
<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;An insignificant lisping hiss.</p>

<p>This shrike is larger than any of the species found in summer
in the United States and has the breast quite distinctly barred.</p>
<p>Shrikes are cruel, rapacious and carnivorous birds, feeding
upon insects, grasshoppers, lizards and small birds. As they
have passerine feet, the same as all our small birds, they are unable
to hold their prey between the feet while tearing it to
pieces, so they impale it upon thorns or the barbs of a wire fence
so they may tear it to shreds with their hooked bill.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Loud snatches consisting of various whistles and
imitations suggesting that of a <a href="#bCatbird">Catbird</a>.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They breed chiefly north of the U. S., placing their
rude, bulky structures of twigs and weeds in thorny trees or
hedges; their four to six eggs are grayish white with spots of
light brown and darker gray (1.08 &times; .80).</p>

<p>Pure white below and with the markings above, intense black
instead of the brownish or grayish black of the last species. Although
smaller, these Shrikes have the same destructive habits
of the northern species. All the Shrikes do considerable good
to mankind, for they eat quantities of grasshoppers and mice,
and probably resort to their diet of small birds when other food
is unusually scarce. It cannot be denied that they are cruel,
for they often kill more than they can eat and leave it impaled
on thorns to decay.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Of harsh, discordant whistles.</p>

<p>Crown slaty gray with a black border; white stripe above eye;
eye reddish brown.</p>
<p>Throughout the United States this is one of the most abundant
of the family. All through the spring and summer
months their warble is heard from woodland and roadside, often
becoming so monotonous as to be irritating. Oftentimes
during the spring migrations of Warblers, Vireos are so numerous
and singing so lustily that it is impossible to hear or distinguish
the songs of any of the smaller birds.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Delivered in parts with intermission of a few seconds

<p>This is one of the least common of the eastern Vireos, although
it is more common than most people know; its song is
not distinctive and it keeps high up in trees, so it is not usually
noticed. Their nests are swung from branches at high altitudes

two prominent whitish wing bars.</p>
<p>A handsome Vireo found in localities such as are frequented
by the Red-eyed species. Nowhere do they appear to be as
abundant as that species, however; they are more abundant
than many suppose, but the difficulty of clearly seeing the yellow
breast when they are feeding in the tree tops, combined
with the similarity of their songs, usually caused them to be
passed by without inspection.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Similar to that of the <a href="#bRedEyedVireo">Red-eye</a>, but louder and more
nasal, less varied and not uttered as often.</p>

<p>Male, heavily streaked with black below; female, with only
a few streaks on the sides.</p>
<p>These Warblers are usually known as Black and White
Creepers because of their habit of creeping along the limbs and
branches of trees. They are abundant in northern United
States, being found in open woods, swamps and often in parks,
gleaning insects and grubs from crevices in the bark.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A weak, thin, wiry &ldquo;tsee, tsee, tsee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of grasses and strips of bark on the ground at the
foot of a stump or tree trunk or beside a rock; they lay four or
five eggs, white with a wreath of reddish brown around the
large end (.65 &times; .55).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Eastern N. A., breeding from Virginia and Louisiana
north to Labrador and Hudson Bay; winters in northern
South America.</p>

<p>Whole head and underparts intense yellow, almost orange on
the head of the male; tail with white spots near the tip; female,
duller.</p>
<p>A common species in the interior, found in bushy swamps
and the willows around the borders of pools and lakes; they are
found in the latter localities with <a href="#bTreeSwallow">Tree Swallows</a> and often
<a href="#bBlackCappedChickadee">Chickadees</a> all nesting in holes in hollow stubs along the bank,
they being one of the few members of this family to make use of

<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud, ringing &ldquo;tweet, tweet, tweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In hollow stubs near or over water, the cavity of the

<p>Upper parts brownish; underparts whitish; a white superciliary
stripe and a brown stripe through the eye.</p>
<p>Some of the habits of this species are similar to those of the
last but they are even more aquatic; they like swamps or
stagnant pools thickly grown with rushes and tangled underbrush;
unless cognizant of their habits, one would never look
for a Warbler in the places frequented by these birds in company
with Least Bitterns and <a href="#bShortBilledMarshWren">Marsh Wrens</a>. Until within a
few years these were regarded as rare birds but are now found
to be not uncommon in certain of the South Atlantic states,
notably Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A series of descending, loud, clear whistles with a
ventriloquial effect.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Quite large structures consisting mostly of leaves
with strips of bark, roots and pine needles. The four or five

<p>Crown buffy with two black stripes; back, wings and tail
olive green with no white markings; below buffy white.</p>
<p>These birds are very unsuspicious and easy to approach; they
spend the greater portion of their time on or near the ground;
they are very fond of spiders and find quantities by overturning
bits of bark and leaves. They also glean part of their living
from the underside of the foliage much as do the <a href="#bRedEyedVireo">Vireos</a>. They
are met with in open woods and brush-grown pastures.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A weak, rapid chipping.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground in depressions under logs, stones or

<p>This species was first discovered by Dr. John Bachman near
Charleston, S. C.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;An insignificant warble or twitter, similar to the

<p>A common bird of the southeastern states and north to Connecticut,
frequenting open woods, thickets and gardens. They
are ground birds, spending most of their time on the ground or
in low bushes which they clean of the insects which are destructive.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud, rapid chirrup, similar to that of the
<a href="#bGrasshopperSparrow">Grasshopper Sparrow</a> but loud and distinct.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of leaves and strips of bark, lined with fine grasses; on

<p>Crown and two large wing bars yellow; throat and ear
patches black; rest of plumage gray and white; female with less
black.</p>
<p>The distribution of this beautiful Warbler is about the same
as that of the last, with which it seems to have many habits in
common. It seems to prefer low ridges and side hills covered
with small bushes.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A buzzing &ldquo;zwee-ze-ze.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of leaves, rootlets, strips of bark and grass; located

<p>Male with a brown crown patch; female duller colored and
with no crown patch. Dry side hills covered with young
trees are favorite resorts for the Warblers. They conceal their
nests on the ground under tufts of dead grass or overhanging
stones. They are often rather shy and hard to sight, but you
can usually hear their song, a lazy sounding &ldquo;ker-chip-chip-chip-cherr-wee-e-e,&rdquo;
ending in a short trill. These birds breed
in the northern half of the U. S. and southern Canada, wintering
in Central America. A sub-species is found on the Pacific
Coast.</p>

<p>Male, with a gray head and greenish back; female, with the
top of the head the same color as the back.</p>
<p>A dull-colored bird that, with the exception of the bill, bears
a strong resemblance to some of the <a href="#bRedEyedVireo">Vireos</a>. Like many others
of our birds, this one has received an inappropriate name, because
the first specimen was shot on the banks of the Cumberland

than in other states during migration.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A simple ditty similar to that of the <a href="#bChippingSparrow">Chipping Sparrow</a>.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Either on the ground or at low elevations in bushes;
of grasses and fibres lined with hair; eggs white, sparsely

ground is covered with a carpeting of moss which only partially
keeps your feet from the water below; the dead trees are covered
with a growth of long, drooping moss; the ends of this

<p>Male, with a chestnut wash on the ears and throat; female,
duller and with little or no chestnut.</p>
<p>In the greater part of eastern North America, Cape May
Warblers are regarded as rare birds; they appear to migrate in
compact bodies, not spreading out over the country as do most
of the others; consequently they may be very common in
restricted areas while lacking entirely in others. I have never
met with but two specimens in Massachusetts. While passing
through the United States you may meet with them in open
woods, parks or in shade trees along the streets of cities.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A thin, high-pitched whistle repeated several times.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of small cedar twigs lined with horse hair, placed

<p>An abundant bird everywhere in woodland, park, orchard or
garden and one of the most vivacious of the family. Arrives in
the north soon after May first and is seen flitting about like a
gleam of sunshine snatching insects from the foliage or darting
after them in the air. Often known as the Summer Yellow-bird.
It frequently nests in garden or orchard trees, where it is
a most welcome tenant.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A sharp, vigorous &ldquo;che-wee, che-wee, che-wee.&rdquo;</p>

Both sexes always have a white patch or speck at the base of
the primaries.</p>
<p>You will find these birds in damp woods or swamps, or less
often in parks or open woods. They are usually seen at low
elevations in scrubby underbrush. Their notes are very peculiar
and will draw attention to them anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A deep grating whistle with a sharply rising inflection,
&ldquo;zee-zee-zwee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In deep, swampy woods, especially common in
laurel; of grapevine bark and rootlets lined with fine black roots

<p>Yellow patches on crown, sides and rump; outer tail feathers

<p>During migrations these pretty birds are very abundant in
the United States. They usually travel in large flocks so that a
small piece of woodland is literally flooded with them when they
pause in the flight to feed upon insects or small berries. They
are often known as Yellow-rumped Warblers.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A clear, broken trill or warble.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest of the Warblers and one of the least
timid. I have often had one or more of these birds follow me
the whole length of a piece of woods apparently out of curiosity,
coming down to the nearest twigs within arms&rsquo; reach of
me. Birch woods are their favorites during migrations, although
a few of them will be found almost anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A short, rapidly uttered warble.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually in coniferous trees, far out on the longer

with greenish above and yellowish below; both have white
patches near the ends of the tail feathers.</p>
<p>These dainty little Warblers are not abundant anywhere, but
seem to be most so in the central states. They are birds of the
tree tops, rarely coming down so that they can be distinctly
seen. They may be more common than supposed, for so small

<p>Whole crown black; female, without black cap, greenish

<p>These birds are one of the latest of the migrants to arrive,
reaching northern United States about the last of May, but
coming in such numbers that they are found everywhere.
While their plumage somewhat resembles that of the Black and
White Warbler, their habits are entirely different.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A high-pitched, hissing whistle similar to that of the

<p>Throat, breast and line from eye to bill yellow.</p>
<p>This species has habits very similar to those of the
<a href="#bBlackAndWhiteWarbler">Black and White Creeper</a>, being often seen creeping around the trunks or
over the branches of trees with almost as much facility as the
<a href="#bWhiteBreastedNuthatch">Nuthatches</a>. They are southern birds and are only rarely or
accidentally found in the northern half of the U. S., and they
are one of the few members of the family that winter in the

<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Loud and similar to that of the <a href="#bIndigoBunting">Indigo Bunting</a>, but
shorter.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually high up in pines and often concealed in tufts

<p>In some plumages these birds may be confused with the
<a href="#bBlackThroatedGreenWarbler">Black-throated Green</a>. Notice that the adult male has a short
median line of yellow on the crown, otherwise the top of head

<p>Throat black; two wing bars and outer tail feathers white;
female with little black on the throat.</p>
<p>A common bird in pine groves in northern United States, or
during migrations in birch woods. I have found them most
abundant on side hills covered with low-growth pines. They
seem to be very nervous and are greatly excited if you appear
near their nests. They often have the habit of building several
nests, whether with the deliberate intent to deceive or whether
because the first was not satisfactory as to location is not
known.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Entirely different from that of any other bird; a

<p>Above bluish gray streaked with black; underparts pale
yellow streaked on the side with black.</p>
<p>This is one of the rarest of American Warblers, and until
1903 but little was known of their habits or range; in that year
they were discovered nesting in Oscoda County, Michigan.
They were found near the banks of a river in Jack pines, building
on the ground and remaining in the underbrush near it.</p>

<p>Greenish yellow above, brighter below; two white wing bars
and white spots on outer tail feathers; female, duller and
grayer.</p>
<p>Found only in tracts of coniferous trees, except during migrations,
when they are often in company with other kinds of
Warblers. They like dry hillsides covered with scrub pines
and are often quite abundant in such localities. They are
rather quiet in their manners, creeping about among the tree
tops like <a href="#bBlackAndWhiteWarbler">Black and White Warblers</a> and occasionally giving
their clear little trill.</p>

<p>No wing bars, but white spots on the outer tail feathers;
crown, cheeks and streaks on the sides chestnut.</p>
<p>During migrations you will find these Warblers along roadsides,
in open woods and scrubby pastures. They are of a very
nervous temperament and, when at rest or when walking, are
continually flirting their tail, a habit which none of the Warblers,
except the <a href="#bWaterThrush">Water-thrush</a>, seem to have. They are one of
the earliest of the family to appear in the spring, reaching
northern United States in April.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A short trill; an ordinary Warbler chirp.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground under shrubs, or sunken in moss;
made of fine grasses, bark and moss; the four eggs are creamy
white with reddish-brown spots.</p>

<p>These are very locally distributed birds and will often be
found breeding abundantly in a small patch of brush-covered
pasture, while many others apparently just as well suited for
their purposes will be shunned by them. They are very active,
flitting rapidly from one bush to another, the male occasionally
mounting to a bush top to hurriedly deliver his song, then
diving out of sight below the foliage.</p>

<p>This bird is found in open woods, where it builds its arched
nest on the ground among the leaves or pine needles. It is the
peculiar oven-like construction of their nests that gives them
their name. They are essentially ground birds, only mounting
to the lower branches of trees to sing or when scolding an intruder.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A peculiar ascending song resembling the word
teacher, repeated five or six times and gathering strength and

Warblers are found in tangled underbrush near water. They
have a habit of continually flirting their tails, thus giving them
the local name of Water-Wagtail. Their call is a sharp
metallic &ldquo;chink&rdquo;; their song a loud, liquid &ldquo;quit-quit-quit-que-quewe-u.&rdquo;

<p>Male with a bluish slate-colored head; eye ring white and

<p>In the United States we find this Warbler only in spring and
fall migrations. They appear to be much more rare in the
spring than in the fall; while I have seen perhaps a hundred in
the fall I have never seen but one in spring. They frequent
wild tangled thickets, such as you often
find <a href="#bMarylandYellowThroat">Maryland Yellow-throats</a>
in. As they do most of their feeding upon the ground
and remain in the depths of the thickets, they are rarely seen

<p>These birds are found in swamps and thickets, as well as
among the bushes and weeds along walls, fences and the edges

<p>Dry side hills and ravines covered with thick underbrush are
the places to look for Chats. Usually if they are present they
will make themselves heard long before you see them. They
are one of the most odd birds both in action and song. They
are mimics of the highest order and can make any kind of
whistle or squawk, but all their vocal efforts seem to require a
great deal of flirting of the tail and twisting of the head. They
even jerk their tail up and down while flying, this making them
appear extremely ludicrous.</p>

<p>Male with yellow forehead and cheeks, the rest of the head

but no bars on the wings.</p>
<p>This is one of the liveliest of the family, being very active in
catching insects on the wing like a true Flycatcher; because of
this habit all the members of this genus are often called Fly-catching
Warblers. They also have a habit of often spreading
and folding the tail as they flit through the underbrush that
they frequent.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A clear, liquid series of whistles; call, a sharp &ldquo;chip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These little fly-catching Warblers are abundant in the
United States during migrations, being found in woods or
swamps, and very often in apple trees when they are in bloom.
They fly about among the outer branches snatching insects
from the foliage or blossoms, and often dashing out to catch one
that is flying by. Their natural quickness is intensified by their
very attractive plumage which harmonizes perfectly with
green leaves.</p>

fields, feeding upon weed seeds. They are shy and take wing
readily, uttering sharp whistles as they wheel about in the air.
They are always restless and stay in a place but a short time.

<p>General color dark gray with a black cap and chestnut under

<p>This is one of the most common birds throughout the United

scrubby pastures. They are very persistent songsters and
have a large repertoire of notes, as well as being able to imitate
those of many other birds. They delight in spending an hour

apparently making their song up as they go along, for it is an
indescribable medley interspersed with various mews and cat
calls.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole I think that the song of this Thrasher is the
most musical and pleasing of any that I have ever heard. It
has a similarity to that of the <a href="#bCatbird">Catbird</a>, but is rounder, fuller and
has none of the grating qualities of the song of that species.

<p>Cactus groves are the favorite resorts of these large Wrens.
Often a bed of cactus not more than thirty feet square will contain
the homes of half a dozen pairs of them. Like all the members
of the family, they are very sprightly and have violent
tempers, scolding any one or anything that incurs their displeasure.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Their nests are placed in cactus or other thorny
shrubs; they are very large, purse-shaped affairs with an entrance
on the side; they are made of little thorny twigs and
grasses woven together, and the interior is warmly lined with
feathers. The four or five eggs are creamy white, finely
sprinkled with reddish brown (.95 &times; .65). Two or three broods

<p>Upper parts stone color, specked with black; rump brownish;
underparts whitish with indistinct streaks on the throat.</p>
<p>A common bird on the dry, rocky foothills of the Rockies and
westward. They are well named, for their favorite places are
among the rocks, where they are always busily engaged in
hunting insects or spiders in the crevices. Owing to their
colors and their habits of slinking away behind the rocks they
are quite difficult to see, but their sweet song is always heard
if any of the birds are in the vicinity.</p>

motion of the tail.</p>

<p>This is the shortest and most stoutly built Wren that we
have. They look very pert with their little stubby tail erect
over their back. In most of the United States we only see
them in the winter, and they are associated, in my mind, with
brush heaps in woods and gardens. They will hide in a small
pile of brush, running from side to side, so that it is almost impossible
to make them leave it.</p>

<p>These odd birds are fairly common throughout the United

up tree trunks, carefully investigating every crevice in the
bark for larv&aelig; or grubs. When they reach the top of one tree,
they drop to the foot of the next and continue the operation.
They are very tame, not seeming to comprehend that danger
can befall them, for they will allow any one to approach very
closely, so that they have been caught under a hat.</p>

<p>736. Carolina Chickadee (Parus carolinensis) is similar to
the last but smaller and with no white edges to the wing
feathers; length 4&frac12; inches; found in southeastern U. S., breeding

<p>The habits of this little northerner are like those of the bird
that we know so well; if anything they are even more tame than
our bird, especially in the vicinity of lumbermen&rsquo;s camps.
They are only met with along our northern border or casually
farther south; I have seen one individual in company with other
Chickadees in Massachusetts.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Not distinguishable from that of our <a href="#bBlackCappedChickadee">Chickadee</a>, but
uttered more incessantly.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In cavities of stumps, trees, posts or telephone poles,
the cavity being lined with grass, feathers and fur; the six or

<p>Adult male with the head and throat yellow, usually with
some concealed orange brown on the forehead; lesser wing-coverts
reddish brown. The female is colored very similarly,
but is much duller. These are among the smallest of N. A.
birds; they are even smaller than their length would indicate,
for their bodies are slender. The birds are usually found in
high dry portions of the country where cacti and thorny bushes
predominate.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Their nests are remarkable structures for so diminutive
birds; flask-shaped, the outside being a mass of thorny
twigs and stems interwoven; this is lined with feathers and the
entrance is a small circular hole near the top. The eggs are
bluish white specked around the large end with reddish brown.</p>

<p>Male with crown orange and yellow, bordered with black;
female with yellow crown.</p>
<p>Although very small, these birds are very rugged and endure
the severe storm and low temperatures of our northern states
apparently with little concern, for they always seem to be
happy. They are always busily engaged among the underbrush
of side hills and along the banks of brooks, hunting for
the scanty fare that awaits them.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A few weak chips, chirps and trills.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A large ball of soft green mosses and feathers, suspended
from the small twigs in the tops of coniferous trees; it is
neatly hollowed out for the reception of the six to nine eggs that
are laid; eggs creamy white, minutely but profusely specked
with brown (.56 &times; .44).</p>

<p>Male with a concealed patch of red on the crown; female with

<p>Like the last, these are chiefly winter visitants in the United
States and they do not remain with us in the coldest weather,
but pass on to the southern half of our country. They are
nearly always met with in pine or other coniferous trees, being
very abundant in spring in open pine woods and parks.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A clear warble, surprisingly loud and varied for so
small a bird; call, a grating chatter.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A ball of moss, grass and feathers, deeply cupped,
like that of the last; partially suspended among the small twigs
in the tops of coniferous trees; eggs white more sparingly
marked than those of the last (.55 &times; .43).</p>

<p>Forehead black; tail black with white edges and tips to the
outer ones.</p>
<p>Their food is chiefly insects, which they are very expert in
catching, taking them on the wing with great celerity. Their
movements are all very rapid, flitting from one part of a tree to
another, but usually among the upper branches. Their nests
are among the most beautiful of bird architecture, even surpassing
that of the <a href="#bRubyThroatedHummingbird">Hummingbird</a>.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Sweet, but very faint.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Situated on horizontal limbs of trees at medium
heights; made of plant fibres, woolly substances and cobwebs,
adorned with handsome lichens; the walls are very high and
thick, the bird sitting so low inside that only her tail is visible;
the four or five eggs are bluish white specked with reddish
brown (.56 &times; .44).</p>

<p>Reddish brown above, brightest on the head; below white
heavily spotted with black.</p>
<p>These large Thrushes are locally abundant in swamps and
moist woodland. They are one of our best songsters, their
tones being very rich and flute-like, and, like most of the
Thrushes, their songs are most often heard along toward night.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Very clear and flute-like, containing many notes of
the scale; often two or more birds answer back and forth from
different parts of the woods; calls, a sharp &ldquo;quit, quit,&rdquo; and a
liquid &ldquo;quirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Either in forks or on horizontal boughs of bushes or
trees, usually not more than ten feet from the ground; made of
grass, weeds, leaves and some mud; the three or four eggs are
bluish green (1.02 &times; .75)</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Eastern U. S., breeding from Virginia and Missouri

<p>Entire upper parts a uniform reddish brown; below soiled
white with a few faint marks on the breast.</p>
<p>This species is more abundant than the last. It is found in
swamps and also in dry open woods, they being especially
numerous where ferns grow luxuriantly.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Very peculiar and not nearly as melodious as that of
the Wood Thrush, but still attractive; a slightly descending
&ldquo;too-whe-u-whe-u-whe-u&rdquo;; call, a clear &ldquo;whee-you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground among the leaves, on hummocks, or
in tangled masses of briars; made of strips of bark and leaves;
eggs greenish blue, darker and smaller than those of the Wood
Thrush (.88 &times; .65).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Eastern N. A., breeding in the northern half of the

<p>Tail reddish brown, much brighter than the back and head;
breast quite heavily spotted with black.</p>
<p>During its migrations it rarely sings, but in its summer home
it is regarded as a remarkable musician. Its song has the
sweetness and purity of tone of that of the Wood Thrush, and
is, perhaps, more varied, but it is not nearly as powerful, and
has a ventriloquial effect. I watched one that was perched on
a dead stump, about twenty feet from me, for several minutes
with a pair of glasses before I could make sure that he was the
author of the song I heard, for it sounded as though coming
from across the next field.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Similar to that of the Wilson Thrush and like that,
placed on the ground or very near it; the eggs are plain greenish
blue (.85 &times; .65).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds from northern U. S. northward, and farther

between the two and with a reddish-brown breast
spotted with black.</p>
<p>These well-known birds are very abundant in the northern
half of the United States, being found most commonly about
farms and dwellings in the country, and also in cities if they are
not persecuted too severely by <a href="#bEnglishSparrow">English Sparrows</a>.</p>
<p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;A loud cheery carol, &ldquo;cheerily-cheerup, cheerily-cheerup,&rdquo;
often long continued.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A coarse but substantial structure of mud and grass,
placed on horizontal boughs or in forks at any height, or in any
odd place about dwellings; the four or five eggs are bluish green
(1.15 &times; .80).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Eastern N. A., breeding from the middle of the U.

<p>The Wheatear is a European bird, but this sub-species is

<p>Their habits are about the same as those of the Bluebird.
They feed upon insects, larv&aelig;, fruits, berries and some seeds.
They are essentially ground birds and are usually found in
rocky country.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Their nests are made of grasses, hair or any rubbish
obtainable, and are hidden in the innermost recesses of crevices
among rocks, in deserted Bank Swallow nests or even in rabbit
burrows.</p>
<p>The four to six eggs are pale greenish blue, a little brighter in

<p><b>Call.</b>&mdash;A short sweet warble; song, a continued warbling.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In holes in trees, particularly in orchards, in bird
boxes or crannies about the buildings. The bottom of the

<p>The first pocket color guides to popular garden favorites&mdash;hardy annuals, herbaceous perennials,
shrubs, evergreens, and some greenhouse plants.</p>
<p>They are the same size and general make-up as the Pocket Guides to the birds, the wild
flowers, etc., which sell each year into the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>The text is concise and up-to-date, and tells how to identify and care for each variety, what
value it has for the garden, and the methods of propagation. All the illustrations have been
specially made for this work by the best plant portrait painters in America.</p>

<p>Each of these four volumes covers the most interesting American varieties of the subject
treated.</p>
<p>A general introduction to each subject is followed by detailed descriptions of the most interesting
families, and of the more important members in each group.</p>

<h3 id="h38">THE BIRD STUDY BOOK</h3>
<p class="center"><b>By T. GILBERT PEARSON</b></p>
<p>The idea here is to present a bird book in which the
beginner or the child can get in simple language the
fundamental facts of bird study. Mr. Pearson, as
Secretary of the National Association of Audubon Societies,
is one of the best informed writers on birds in
America.</p>
<p>He is just the author to kindle enthusiasm. A few of
the questions and subjects suggested by a reading of &ldquo;The
Bird Study Book&rdquo; are:</p>
<p>How to get on neighborly terms with the birds.</p>
<p>Do birds have more than one mate?</p>
<p>Bird spinsters.</p>
<p>What bird is called the &ldquo;Outcast&rdquo;?</p>
<p>What birds winter in your particular locality?</p>
<p>How many birds are there in the world?</p>
<p>Birds that are no more&mdash;the story of the Labrador Duck,
the Great Auk, the Wild Pigeon.</p>
<p>All about bird boxes.</p>

valuable companion volume to these books.</p>

it is self-fertilized or cross fertilized by insects and how; in fact it gives a great deal more information
than one would think possible in a book to fit comfortably in the pocket.</p>

<h3 id="h323">BIRDS OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA</h3>
<p class="center"><b>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</b></p>
<p>This will undoubtedly be THE BIRD BOOK of the year. It is authentic. The author
KNOWS birds. He has studied them for thirty years&mdash;in the hand, for plumage, and
in their haunts, for habits. He has studied them in their homes and has photographed
hundreds as they were actually feeding their young. Besides being able to write about these
things in an interesting and instructive manner, he is classed as one of the foremost bird artists in
America. This rare combination of Artist-Author-Naturalist has produced, in &ldquo;Birds of Eastern
North America,&rdquo; the ultimate bird book.</p>

<h3 id="h324">AMERICAN GAME BIRDS</h3>
<p class="center"><b>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</b></p>
<p>Certain species and families of our wild birds are classed as game and can, at certain
seasons, be legally hunted for sport or for food. A great number of books have been
written for sportsmen and by sportsmen, most of them containing but a very few black
and white illustrations of some of the species mentioned. As far as we know, AMERICAN
GAME BIRDS is the <i>only</i> sportsman&rsquo;s book illustrating nearly all of these birds in NATURAL
COLORS. With it, the novice can identify any game bird he secures or sees, and the old-timer, as
well, can see just what sportsmen in other sections of the country are shooting. The illustrations
are excellent reproductions by the very best process from water-color paintings made directly
from the birds.</p>
<p>The text portrays their habits just as truly as the pictures do their appearance, and the two
together give the reader a correct impression of each species, such as can be gained in no other
way except by long association with the birds. Mr. Reed knows birds as few others do, and has
hunted, studied and photographed them from Labrador to Florida, and from the Atlantic to the
Pacific.</p>
<p>More than 100 species illustrated in natural colors.</p>
